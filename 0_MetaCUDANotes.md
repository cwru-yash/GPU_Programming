A cycle corresponds to one full waveform of the GPU clock signal.
Let‚Äôs clarify it a bit more visually and conceptually:

üìâ What Is a Clock Signal?
Imagine a square wave going from low ‚Üí high ‚Üí low.

Each rising edge (low to high transition) typically triggers an operation inside digital circuits (like CUDA cores).

The time from one rising edge to the next is one clock cycle (i.e., one tick).

üîÅ One Cycle = One Waveform Period
If a GPU runs at 1 GHz, that‚Äôs 1 billion waveforms per second.

Each waveform period = 1 nanosecond.

And yes ‚Äî every cycle is one oscillation of this square wave that syncs the entire GPU‚Äôs operations.

üîß How It Applies to CUDA
The clock coordinates how fast your CUDA threads execute instructions.

A shared memory access taking 5 cycles means it needs 5 clock waveforms to complete.

A global memory access taking 500 cycles? 500 waveforms. Much slower.



1. **`__syncthreads()`** is a **device-level** barrier that synchronizes all threads within a **single thread block**. It ensures that all threads in the block reach the synchronization point before any are allowed to proceed. It's used to coordinate shared memory access and avoid race conditions.

2. **`cudaDeviceSynchronize()`** is a **host-level** function that blocks the host (CPU) thread until all preceding CUDA calls on the device (GPU) are complete across **all thread blocks**. It's typically used to ensure that kernel executions are done before accessing results or performing subsequent actions on the host.

In summary:

* Use `__syncthreads()` inside a kernel to synchronize threads within a block.
* Use `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` in host code to wait for all GPU activities to complete.

This distinction is crucial for both performance and correctness in CUDA applications.


Cache-Tiled MM:

üîß 1. Computing Partial Results
‚è¨ Step-by-Step:
Each thread block loads a tile of matrix A and matrix B into shared memory.

Suppose the tile size is TILE_SIZE x TILE_SIZE.

Each thread in the block computes one element of the result submatrix Ctile using:

                    Ctile[i][j]+=Ashared[i][k]‚àóBshared[k][j]
This is just one tile-tile multiplication step.

üîÑ Example:
For a tile from A and B:

Ashared = [[1, 2],
           [5, 6]]

Bshared = [[16, 15],
           [12, 11]]
Then for thread (0, 0) in the tile, it computes:


            C[0][0]+=1√ó16+2√ó12=16+24=40
Every thread in the tile does this for its corresponding (i, j) element.

üîÑ 2. Accumulating Results
Since a full matrix multiplication involves summing over the shared axis, say for matrix dimensions:

                                    Ci,j= k‚àëAi,k‚ãÖB k,j
‚Äã
 
You loop over all tile positions along the shared dimension (commonly k) and keep adding the partial results computed from the tiles. That‚Äôs what ‚Äúaccumulation‚Äù means.

Each thread holds a running total like:

float temp = 0;
for (int t = 0; t < numTiles; ++t) {
    temp += Ashared[threadIdx.y][t] * Bshared[t][threadIdx.x];
}
C[row * N + col] = temp;

‚úÖ What is std?

using std::cout;
using std::generate;
using std::vector;


In C++, std is the standard namespace. It contains all the standard C++ library classes, functions, and objects‚Äîlike cout, vector, generate, etc.

To avoid writing std:: everywhere, we sometimes pull specific things into the current scope using using.

üìå Breakdown of Each Line
1. using std::cout;
Brings std::cout (the standard console output stream) into your current scope. This means instead of:

std::cout << "Hello";
you can just write:

cout << "Hello";
2. using std::generate;
Brings in the algorithm function std::generate, which fills a range (like a vector) with values generated by a function/lambda.

Example:

std::vector<int> v(10);
std::generate(v.begin(), v.end(), [] { return rand() % 100; });
This fills the vector with random values.

3. using std::vector;
Brings the class template std::vector into scope. So instead of:

std::vector<int> myVec;
You can now write:

vector<int> myVec;
