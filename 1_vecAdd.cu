// This can help the compiler optimize memory access

//  assert() --> The assert() function is a debugging aid that checks a condition at runtime. If the condition is false, the program:
// Prints an error message (with the failed condition and file/line number), Aborts execution (by calling abort()).
// To verify assumptions that should always be true during program execution. If theyâ€™re not, it indicates a logic error (bug) in your code.

// Think of assert() as a safety net to, Catch errors early during development. Help with unit testing or sanity checks.
// Avoid undefined behavior from bad data or logic bugs.
